# medRAG
MedRAG is an open-source agentic pipeline for generating accurate, interpretable medical image reports using RAG. It analyzes X-ray images, retrieves evidence from medical knowledge bases, and produces both clinician-style reports and layperson summaries with citations. A safety agent ensures factuality and responsible medical guidance.
